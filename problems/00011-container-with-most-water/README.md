You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n`
vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the `iÂ°` line are
`(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such
that the container contains the most water.

Return _the maximum amount of water a container can store_.

**Notice** that you may not slant the container.

**Example 1:**

> **Input:** height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
>
> **Output:** 49
>
> **Explanation:** The above vertical lines are represented by array
> [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue
> section) the container can contain is 49.

**Example 2:**

> **Input:** height = [1,1]
>
> **Output:** 1

**Constraints:**
- `n == height.length`
- `2 <= n <= 10^5`
- `0 <= height[i] <= 10^4`
