You are given a string `s` and an array of strings `words`. All the
strings of `words` are of **the same length**.

A **concatenated string** is a string that exactly contains all the
strings of any permutation of `words` concatenated.

- For example, if `words = ["ab","cd","ef"]`, then `"abcdef"`,
  `"abefcd"`, `"cdabef`", `"cdefab"`, `"efabcd"`, and `"efcdab`" are
  all concatenated strings. `"acdbef"` is not a concatenated string
  because it is not the concatenation of any permutation of `words`.

Return an array of _the starting indices_ of all the concatenated
substrings in `s`. You can return the answer in **ana order**.

**Example 1:**

> **Input:** s = "barfoothefoobarman", words = ["foo","bar"]
>
> **Output:** [0,9]
>
> **Explanation:**
>
> - The substring starting at 0 is `"barfoo"`. It is the
>   concatenation of `["bar","foo"]` which is a permutation of `words`.
> - The substring starting at 9 is `"foobar"`. It is the
>   concatenation of `["foo","bar"]` which is a permutation of words.

**Example 2:**

> **Input:** s = "wordgoodgoodgoodbestword", words = ["word","good","best","word"]
>
> **Output:** []
>
> **Explanation:**
>
> There is no concatenated substring.

**Example 3:**

> **Input:** s = "barfoofoobarthefoobarman", words = ["bar","foo","the"]
>
> **Output:** [6,9,12]
>
> **Explanation:**
>
> - The substring starting at 6 is `"foobarthe"`. It is the
>   concatenation of `["foo","bar","the"]`.
> - The substring starting at 9 is `"barthefoo"`. It is the
>   concatenation of `["bar","the","foo"]`.
> - The substring starting at 12 is `"thefoobar"`. It is the
>   concatenation of `["the","foo","bar"]`.

**Constraints:**

- <code>1 <= s.length <= 10<sup>4</sup></code>
- `1 <= words.length <= 5000`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 30`
- `s` and `words[i]` consist of lowercase English letters.
